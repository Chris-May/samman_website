# User Documentation and unit tests

Unit tests form part of the documentation for your code. They should probably not be the entirety of the documentation. In this learning hour we look at some tools and techniques for writing user documentation.

## Learning Goals
- describe some additional elements you expect in user documentation over unit tests.
- operate a pre-existing script to generate html documentation from markdown and code snippets.
- prepare a unit test and some user documentation for a new feature.

## Session Outline

* 15 min conclusions: 


### Concrete
