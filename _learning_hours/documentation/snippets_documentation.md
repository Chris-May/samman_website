# User Documentation and code snippets

Note: this learning hour is still being developed

Unit tests form part of the documentation for your code. They should probably not be the entirety of the documentation. In this learning hour we look at using code snippets in documentation.

## Learning Goals
- describe some additional elements you expect in user documentation over unit tests.
- operate a pre-existing script to generate html documentation from markdown and code snippets.
- prepare a unit test and some user documentation for a new feature.

## Session Outline

* 10 min connect: documentation chores
* 10 min concept: Unit tests and documentation
* 20 min concrete: Write a how-to guide for a new feature
* 15 min conclusions: Swap documents and give feedback


### Connect: Documentation chores
Why is documentation a chore?

### Concrete
In the [Recently-Used-List-Docs](https://github.com/emilybache/Recently-Used-List-Docs) project there is some code and unit tests and example documentation.
