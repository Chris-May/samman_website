# Test Fixture Introduction

Reduce duplication by using a test fixture. Let's look at the basic syntax.

## Session Outline

* 5 min connect: Duplication and Readability
* 10 min concept: Test Fixture 
* 30 min concrete: convert code to use fixture
* 5 min conclusions: What is a custom assert, what is a test fixture

## Connect: Duplication and Readability
- Give me three reasons why code duplication can be a problem. 
- Is duplication in test code an exception? Is it a problem?

## Concept: Test Fixture
Explain what it is, ask them to google for 2 minutes to find the documentation for the language and framework you're using. Ask them to find a good worked example.

Ask people to share the links to the resources they found and spend a few more minutes looking through each other's links together.

## Concrete: Convert duplication to fixture

In RecentlyUsedList, there are several tests which share common code. Refactor them to use a test fixture.

## Conclusions
Note down in your own words what you learnt about a custom assert and a test fixture.
