# Unit Test FIRST properties

Introducing Tim Ottinger & Brett Schuchert's FIRST properties from "Agile in a Flash".

## Learning Goals

* List some important properties of a unit test, especially that they should be Fast and Isolated.
* Recognize tests that have FIRST properties and those that do not.

## Session Outline

* 10 min connect: Three facts and a question on unit test design
* 15 min concept: FIRST properties and active review
* 20 min concrete: write unit tests
* 5 min conclusions: review facts and question on unit test design

### Connect
Use the ["Three facts and a question"](/activities/connect/three_facts_and_a_q.html) format with the topic "Designing Good Unit Tests".

### Concept
Explain the [FIRST properties](http://agileinaflash.blogspot.com/2009/02/first.html). Get people to actively review the properties by showing them some code samples and ask them to assess whether they have each property.

### Concrete
Write some unit tests that have FIRST properties. Suggested exercise: [LeapYears](/kata_descriptions/leap_years.html) or Filename Range from [cyber-dojo](http://cyber-dojo.org). The idea is to choose an exercise where the code under test is a pure function and relatively easy to write tests for.

### Conclusions
Review your facts and questions from the first part of the session. Can you answer any of the questions? Do any of the facts need reviewing? Annotate the notes you made with new notes detailing things you learnt during the session.
