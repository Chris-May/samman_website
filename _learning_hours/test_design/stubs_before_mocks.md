# Stubs before Mocks

## Outline


### Connect - three facts and a question
On the topic of Stubs - give me three facts and a question.

### Concept - Test Doubles
Go through Meszaros' definitions of Test Double, Mock, Stub, Fake. Difference between a mock and a stub - mocks can fail the test if they don't get an expected call. Prefer to use stubs, they are simpler. Demo creating a stub with their preferred mocking framework. Point out you don't need to replace a ValueObject with a stub.
