Reading code you don’t have to change is waste.
Names that are honest and complete can mitigate lack of design,
while the design is worked on. 
Show a small demo exercise for each one.

## Objective
Know what steps to take to get a name that can be trusted.

## Connect

Collect "Most unexpected thing a method did, judging from its name."
Work in pairs or as a group, depending on group size. 


## Concept

Talking about how names are important to have to read less code.

”Don’t hide bad design behind pretty names.”

7 stages of naming  https://www.digdeeproots.com/articles/c/series/


Focus on  Nonsense, honest & honest + complete

Honest Nonsense is better than deception
Honest and specific about one thing, and what we don’t say
Honest and complete

Step one, nonsense is unmasking the name that already is nonsense, only dishonest nonsense.


## Concrete
### Active review
Sort nonsense, honest incomplete, honest

Honest nonsense:
- Applesauce
- Chutney 
- Sauerkraut 
- Ketchup

Honest incomplete:
- GetBestOffersAndUpdateSomething
- ParseJSONToUsersAndThenSome
- CalculateDistanceAndPutInTheCloudPerhaps
- LayoutSubViewsButThereIsMore

Honest complete:
- GetMatchingRecipeAndUpdateShoppingListIfFriday
- LayoutSubviewsUnlessLegacyPhoneThenLoadLegacyView
- SetGradientUnlessShapeFactoryMissingThenUseDefault
- FindAllUsersAndEveryMonthBackupAllData

### Try it yourselves  
Look at code and edit the name for the function,
while crossing out parts of the code on Miro.

Tools:
- Screenshot of code.
- Textfield/paper for editing name.
- Ways to mark the code that is represented in the name.


## Conclude
Write down these steps and practice to use them when you get stuck when naming.
