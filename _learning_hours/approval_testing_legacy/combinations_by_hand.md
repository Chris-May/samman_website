# Approval Testing with Combinations

Sometimes you discover you can get great test coverage by varying the input arguments to a narrow interface.

## Learning Objectives

* describe how to use a printer instead of an assertion
* use approval testing to test many input combinations
* contrast an approval testing approach with an assertion based approach in this case

## Session Outline
 
* 10 min connect: review assertion based tests for yatzy
* 5 min concept: adding a printer then testing combinations
* 35 min concrete: add more test combinations
* 10 min reflect: compare your tests with the assertion-based version
