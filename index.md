title: Samman Technical Coaching Materials
---

This site contains materials that supplement the book ["Technical Agile Coaching with the Samman method"](https://leanpub.com/techagilecoach) by Emily Bache.

You are free to copy these materials and use them in your own work, so long as you give credit where it's due. This entire site is released under a [Creative Commons Share Alike license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/), and the credit to use is "SammanCoaching.org". 

I hope these materials will be a starting point, not a finished product you can deliver as-is. I think you'll get better results if you customize these materials for your own situation and your own strengths as a teacher. You are a unique, competent human person with many skills and experiences to draw on. People will learn more if you bring your personal enthusiasm and ideas into your teaching. Try out these materials, work on them, add to them - and make them your own.
