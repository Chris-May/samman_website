# Samman Technical Coaching

Samman Technical Coaching is a method for people who want to make a difference and improve the way software is built. The focus is specifically on technical practices and how people write code. A Samman coach divides their time between several software development teams and there are two main parts to the method: 

- Learning Hour
- Ensemble Working

In the learning hour the coach uses exercises and active learning techniques to teach the theory and practice of skills like Test-Driven Development and Refactoring. In the Ensemble sessions the whole team collaborates together with the coach in applying agile development techniques in their usual production codebase. Note - some people may know ensemble working by its other name: 'mob programming'.

The expected outcome is that the teams work more effectively and consistently with agile techniques even after the coach has moved on. Good technical practices mean the organization can build new features with a shorter lead time and higher quality. 

Some benefits of the Samman method for the coach:

- Doing challenging, interesting work, coding with others daily.
- Having a bigger effect than you perhaps would in other roles, seeing results in many teams.
- A community of other coaches using the method, giving you support and professional development opportunities.
