title: Technical Agile Coaching Materials
---

This site contains materials that supplement the book ["Technical Agile Coaching"](https://leanpub.com/techagilecoach) by Emily Bache. One part of this coaching is teaching software development techniques. Many of the pages on this site comprise lesson plans for those teaching sessions. 

You are free to copy these materials and lesson plans and use them in your own work, so long as you give credit where it's due. This entire site is released under a [Creative Commons Share Alike license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/). 

I hope these materials will be a starting point, not a finished product you can deliver as-is. I think you'll get better results if you customize these materials for your own situation and your own strengths as a teacher. As Gerald Weinberger says "it tastes better when you add your own egg" (Chapter 11, "The Secrets of Consulting"). 

You are a unique, competent human person with many skills and experiences to draw on. People will learn more if you bring your personal enthusiasm and ideas into your teaching. Try out these materials, work on them, add to them - and make them your own.
