# Refactorings

This is a collection of descriptions of [Refactorings](https://refactoring.com/). The descriptions are original to this site although many of the names are taken from Martin Fowler's book "Refactoring" 2nd Edition.

Many of these refactorings can be performed automatically by a tool. In some cases the refactoring description includes references to specific tools. This is intended to help you use your tools better, but be warned - these tools are frequently updated and descriptions may not always be entirely correct.
