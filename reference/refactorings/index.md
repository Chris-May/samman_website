# Refactorings

This is a collection of descriptions of [Refactorings](https://refactoring.com/). The descriptions are original to this site although many of the names are taken from Martin Fowler's book "Refactoring" 2nd Edition.

In some cases the refactoring descriptions includes references to ways your IDE can help you do them more safely. This is intended to help you use your tools better, but be warned - IDEs differ in details and are frequently updated. Descriptions may not always be entirely correct. If there is a note your IDE can help you but yours doesn't seem to do that, look around the menus and see if the assistance is there just under another name.
