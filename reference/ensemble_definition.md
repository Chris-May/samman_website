# Ensemble Working - Definition

Ensemble working - when a whole team works together on the same thing, at the same time, in the same space, on the same computer.

You call it _Ensemble Programming_ when you're working on a programming task, and _Ensemble Testing_ when it's a testing task.

The term _Ensemble Programming_ is a synonym for [Mob Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mob_programming): it's the same thing. In Samman coaching, we prefer to use the word "Ensemble" because it sounds more friendly. We prefer to use a word that calls to mind a group of musicians playing together and creating something beautiful.
