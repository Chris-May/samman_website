# Deliver Learning Hours - Samman Coaching Training

Using materials provided by the Samman Society when leading learning hour sessions is a real jump-start for a technical coach. The idea is that with only a little preparation, all kinds of developers and coaches can put on a valuable session for their team. This course is designed to take you to the next level, explaining the teaching techniques and learning hour design principles that lie behind the Samman Society learning hour materials. We want to set you up for success leading these sessions and give you a chance to learn from more experienced coaches.

The training is held online in several parts held over a period of 6-8 weeks. It begins and ends with a half day of training. In between are short 'session briefing' meetings where we go through the details of a learning hour you can lead with your team in the following week. In this way you get hands-on practice using the skills you're learning about, and a chance to get advice afterwards.

You will come away with the knowledge you need to lead learning hours with your colleagues using materials that have been developed by others. If you are an experienced trainer in other contexts already then this course could give you enough knowledge to begin designing and leading learning hours based on your own materials. If you are less experienced with teaching and coaching we plan to offer a follow-up course later on that will help you to design your own materials - this course is an introduction.

This online training is highly interactive and participatory, and is normally led by a pair of experienced coaches from the Samman Technical Coaching Society.
