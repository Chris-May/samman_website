# Deliver Learning Hours - Samman Coaching Training
_Lead learning hours with your team_

Using materials provided by the Samman Society when leading learning hour sessions is a real jump-start for a technical coach. The idea is that with only a little preparation, all kinds of developers and coaches can put on a valuable session for their team. This course is designed to take you to the next level, explaining the teaching techniques and learning hour design principles that lie behind the Samman Society learning hour materials. We want to set you up for success leading these sessions and give you a chance to learn from more experienced coaches.

The training is held online in three parts held over a period of 3-4 weeks. Between sessions you can expect to spend 1-2 hours on study and preparation. The idea is you will lead a learning hour for the group as well as take part in learning hours led by other participants. In this way you get hands-on practice using the skills you're learning about, and a chance to get advice from experienced coaches.

## Course Topics:

* How Learning Hours are used as part of Technical coaching with the Samman method
* Sharon Bowman's 4C teaching model
* Setting learning goals
* Facilitation skills for interactive learning activities
* Adapting materials and activities for the needs of your team

You will come away with the knowledge you need to lead learning hours with your colleagues using materials that have been developed by others. If you are an experienced trainer in other contexts already then this course could give you enough knowledge to begin designing and leading learning hours based on your own materials. If you are less experienced with teaching and coaching we plan to offer a follow-up course later on that will help you to design your own materials - this course is an introduction.

This online training is highly interactive and participatory, and is normally led by a pair of experienced coaches from the Samman Technical Coaching Society.
