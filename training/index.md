# Samman Coaching Training

The Samman Society offers official training courses in skills that are essential for Samman Coaching. This is a new addition to the work of the society and the range and type of courses is still being developed. 

## Introducing Ensemble 

Before a team will be able to work smoothly in an ensemble you usually need to explain the structure, roles, and underlying principles to them. They will also need some hands-on practice working this way with a straightforward piece of code before they tackle the complexity of their production code. This course introduces all the important aspects for successful ensemble in a structured way that is tried and tested.

The hope is that later on you'd be able to use the course materials to repeat this same training with any teams you are part of or are coaching. We want to set you up for success both as a team member introducing ensemble to your colleagues, or as a coach working with an unfamiliar group.

This half-day online training is highly interactive and participatory, and is normally led by a pair of experienced coaches from the Samman Technical Coaching Society.

### Course dates

* 12th December with [Emily Bache]({% link society/contributors/emilybache.md %}) and [Nitsan Avni]({% link society/contributors/nitsanavni.md %}) - [more information](http://bacheconsulting.com/events/tech-coach-facilitate-ensemble.html)

## Deliver Learning Hours

This course can help you use materials provided by the Samman Society to lead learning hour sessions. You'll gain a stronger understanding of the teaching techniques and learning hour design principles that work well for developer training. We want to set you up for success either as a team member leading learning hours with your colleagues, or as a technical coach working with an unfamiliar group.

The training is held online with several sessions held over a period of 6-8 weeks. It begins and ends with a half day of training. In between are short 'session briefing' meetings where we go through the details of a learning hour you can lead with your team in the following week. In this way you get hands-on practice using the skills you're learning about, and a chance to get advice afterwards.

This online training is highly interactive and participatory, and is normally led by a pair of experienced coaches from the Samman Technical Coaching Society.

### Course dates

We expect to announce some course dates for this training soon.
