# Join the Samman Technical Coaching Society

Would you like to join the ranks of Samman Technical Coaches who create and maintain this website? Would you like to be able to call yourself a member of the Samman Technical Coaching Society?

Benefits of joining:
- Your own member page where you can list your affilitations and link to your professional website.
- Attend conferences and member-only events
- Be part of an online community of technical coaches

Membership is offered to technical coaches who are recommended by our onboarding committee. Before being invited to join, you will need to demonstrate your competence at facilitating Ensemble working sessions and leading learning hours.

We normally expect new members to have been through a train-the-trainer programme together with existing Samman Coaching Society members. This training is offered via partner organizations, and you can find out what courses are available on our [Training](training.html) page.
