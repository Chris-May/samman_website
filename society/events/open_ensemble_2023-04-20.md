# Samman Society Open Ensemble

**Thursday 20th April 2023, 15:00 - 17:00 CET**

_Introduction to Ensemble programming._

More and more developers are realizing ensemble or mob programming is a great way to work. You can write high quality code, share knowledge and keep everyone in the loop as you make progress against your development tasks and goals.

* Development teams use ensemble working to do their normal work and raise quality.
* Technical coaches use ensemble as a teaching forum for the teams they work with.
* Dev leads and architects can share knowledge and skills with the teams they are responsible for.
* Open source projects host ensemble sessions where new contributors can work with experienced contributors.

For a group that's never worked this way before it can be a little daunting and doesn't always go as well as you hoped the first time. This session is an introduction to the roles and basic structures of ensemble collaboration. We'll do a code kata in Java, although the focus will be on collaboration techniques. Don't worry if you're not that familiar with Java, we'll help you.

Coming to this session will give you the skills you need to:

* take part in open ensembles like those organized by [Mobus Operandi](https://mobusoperandi.com/), 
* start your own ensemble internally at your company 
* Begin hosting an ensemble for your favourite open source project.
