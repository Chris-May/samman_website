# Using Approval Testing in Behaviour Driven Development

Typically people use a Gherkin-syntax tool like Cucumber for BDD, but here we will explore scenarios and set up test cases with an approval testing approach. We look at the key aspects of BDD: 

- Discovery
- Formulation
- Automation

and how each is affected by choosing an Approval testing approach.


We will go through a worked example in small groups and practice doing BDD with an approval testing approach. Each group can agree which programming language to use for the automation part, with a choice of Java, C#, Python, C++ and Go.
