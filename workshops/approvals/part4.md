# Approval Testing with Microservices

Microservices is a popular architectural choice today, and it opens up new possibilities for automated testing. We will look at how you could use Approval testing to:

- test one microservice via its api
- test a group of microservices fulfilling a whole user-perspective scenario

We will work in small groups to write tests for an example microservice application.
