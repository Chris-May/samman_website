# Using Coverage and Combinations with Legacy Code

When you inherit valuable but difficult code that you need to change, this approach can enable you to add some tests without necessarily really understanding the code.

- Using coverage to identify missing test cases
- Using Combinations to increase confidence


We work through some exercises adding tests to legacy code  using the ['Approvals'](https://github.com/approvals) tool. We will work in small groups and each group can agree which programming language to use. The exercises are generally available in Java, C#, Python and C++.
