# Learning Goal Voting

- Time: 2-7 minutes

Display the learning goals in an attractive way, for example each written on a different coloured note. Ask people to read all the goals and put a marker (dot, tick, emoji) next to the ones that are most important for them personally. 

Give people a limited number of votes so they actually need to prioritize. For example if there are five learning goals, give them 2 votes.

## Optional follow-up

When they have voted, ask people to return to their tables or breakout rooms. Give them 3-5 minutes to explain to one another why they picked those learning goals. 

## Benefits

This activity has people actually read through the learning goals for the session and start to think about whether they want to learn those things. If you include the follow-up, it lets them discuss more about what they hope to learn during the training and connect with one another.
