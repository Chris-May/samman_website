# Learning Goal Voting

- Time: 2-5 minutes

Display the learning goals in an attractive way, for example each written on a different coloured note. Ask people to read all the goals and put a marker (dot, tick, emoji) next to the ones that are most important for them personally. 

Give people a limited number of votes so they actually need to prioritize. For example if there are five learning goals, give them 2 votes.

## Optional follow-up

Ask people to explain why they picked those ones to the others at their table or in their breakout room.

## Benefits

This activity has people actually read through the learning goals for the session and start to think about whether they want to learn those things.
