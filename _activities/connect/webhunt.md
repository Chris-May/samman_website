# Web Hunt

- Time: 15-20 minutes

Give them a question to research and find resources about. Ask them to look in places like:

- their organization's internal wiki or documentation repository
- Wikipedia or another website with lots of good reference materials
- Their own personal browsing history

## Practicalities

Work individually or in pairs. Give them an online document to share links to materials they find. After 5-10 minutes of searching, spend another 5-10 minutes having each group show what they found. You could organize the materials into different categories or highlight materials which you think are particularly useful. 

## Benefits
You find out where they usually go for information and what kinds of things they already know about. They get reminded that they already know about the topic and/or have places they know to look and/or colleagues who know where to look.
