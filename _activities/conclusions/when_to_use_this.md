# When should you use this?

- Time: 2-3 minutes

Now you've looked at a new technique, ask people to think about _when_ to use it. Either have them discuss in pairs for a couple of minutes, or have them write a sentence on a sticky note and share it with the group, or just ask for ideas in a whole group setting and write up whatever they say on the board.

## Benefits
They begin to think about when the new technique would be applicable and hopefully look out for those situations.
