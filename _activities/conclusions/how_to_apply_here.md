# Does our code have this issue?

Ask people to discuss in pairs for 3 minutes. Pose a question like

* Can you think of code you've written where you could have applied _this technique we learnt about just now_?

## Benefits
Participants leave the session thinking about how they could apply what they've learnt. However, the disadvantage of them discussing in pairs is you don't get to hear whether they think the technique was useful!
