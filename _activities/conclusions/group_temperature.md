# Raising the Group Temperature

- Time: 5-10 minutes

On a scale of 1-5 how confident do you feel about applying _this technique_ in your production code?

Then spend 2 minutes discussing in pairs. Can you come up with any strategies to raise the group temperature? 

After the discussion in pairs, ask of anyone is willing to share their strategies with the whole group. Listen to as many as volunteer.

## Benefits
You get an idea about how confident they feel about the technique. They come up with their own ideas for how to follow-up. By telling them to the group they are more likely to actually do those things. Hopefully those who are more confident will think of ways to assist those who are less confident.
