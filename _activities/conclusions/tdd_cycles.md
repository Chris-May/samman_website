# TDD Cycles

- Time: 5-10 minutes

If you've used a tool like cyber-dojo that records your test runs and results, each pair can look over the history of their session.

- Can you spot clear TDD cycles?
- What does it look like when your TDD is going off track? Could you have spotted that sooner and corrected?

If you ask the pairs to share their analysis with the group, be sure to ask them what they will look for next time to help them keep on track with TDD. 

## Benefits
The visual history of test runs should make it clear to people if they are successfully completing TDD cycles. They will hopefully spot more quickly next time if it's been too long since they had green tests.
