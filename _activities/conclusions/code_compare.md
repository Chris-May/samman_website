# Code comparison

- Time: 5-10 minutes

Prepare a sample solution to the exercise they've been working on in the session. It could be a solution from a previous group tackling the same problem, or one you came up with. Ask them to compare their solution with it. Give them a checklist of things specifically to look at, for example

- How many test cases and assertions are there?
- How good is the test coverage?
- How do you rate the readability of the solution?
- Can you spot any code smells?

When they've done that, ask them to make a shortlist of things to remember next time they use this technique/tackle this kind of problem.


## Benefits
They might get an idea of how far they have to go before they master the technique. Try not to make it discouraging for them though. If they share their things to remember checklist with you, remind them to use it next time you tackle a similar problem.
