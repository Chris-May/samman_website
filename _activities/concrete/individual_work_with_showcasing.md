# Individual work with showcasing

Everyone in the group works on the same task individually, in parallel, for a fixed time. The results are shared in an online document or whiteboard so everyone can see each other's work. The facilitator picks one person's work to showcase. They can give feedback on what consequences this design/code/idea would have in different situations.

Usually you repeat this activity several times in a session - 5-10 minutes everyone creates something, 5-10 minutes showcasing, repeat 3-5 times. Each activity can build on the previous one, so you practice several aspects around the same topic, or you can cover several unrelated topics.

## Benefits and Pitfalls
* Most people are actively doing something most of the time.
* The facilitator can steer the group and give feedback during the showcasing part.
* If the individual work goes on for more than about 10 minutes people may get bored or off-track.
* This is a good way to gain fluency with applying a technique, since there is so much hands-on time for each person. 
* If individuals don't have any competency or understanding of the technique beforehand, they may get stuck or confused and not produce anything useful during their individual work.
