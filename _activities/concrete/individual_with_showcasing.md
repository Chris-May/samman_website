# Individual work with showcasing

Everyone in the group works on the same task individually, in parallel, for a fixed time. The results are shared in an online document or whiteboard so everyone can see each other's work. The facilitator picks one person's work to showcase. They may give feedback on how good it is, or what consequences this design/code/idea would have in different situations.

Often you repeat this activity several times in a session - 5-10 minutes everyone creates something, 5-10 minutes showcasing, repeat 3-4 times. Each activity can build on the previous one.

## Benefits
* Most people are actively doing something most of the time
* The facilitator can steer the group and give feedback during the showcasing part
