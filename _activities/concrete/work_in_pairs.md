# Work in Pairs

Divide into pairs to work on an exercise. The facilitator can go round and assist pairs as they need it. Either divide up randomly or deliberately pair juniors with more senior people.

## Benefits
* Each person gets quite a bit of hands-on practice actively doing the exercise
* If one person gets stuck hopefully their pair can help them without needing the facilitator to step in
* Not too stressful for the facilitator - if no pairs need help, they can relax
