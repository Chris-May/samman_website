# Facilitated Ensemble

The whole group works on the exercise together using a shared machine. The facilitator can prompt and direct and assist to keep the group on track. Ideally there will also be written instructions for the group to follow, so the facilitator can stay more in the background.

## Benefits and Pitfalls
* The facilitator can keep the whole group on track at once (more easily than if they work in pairs).
* You only need to prepare one machine with the exercise, libraries etc (easier than preparing machines for several pairs).
* If the group is large or not used to working this way, people can get distracted and tune out.
* This is a good approach if the technique is relatively unfamiliar to the group and your learning goal is competency or understanding of it.
