# Facilitated Ensemble

The whole group works on the exercise together using a shared machine. The facilitator can prompt and direct and assist to keep the group on track. There may also be written instructions for the group to follow, so the facilitator can stay more in the background.

## Benefits
* The facilitator can keep the whole group on track at once (more easily than if they work in pairs)
* You only need to prepare one machine with the exercise, libraries etc (easier than preparing machines for several pairs)
