# Code Demo

Demonstrate a coding technique by showing how to do it in real time in a coding environment. 

## Top tips
Live demos can be risky and stressful. 
* You could make a screen recording in advance without audio, then in the session you can talk over it, explaining what's going on. Pause the video when needed.
* Some coaches publish their demos on the internet, if you find one you like you could just show it in the session.
