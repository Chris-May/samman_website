# Lecture

You talk about the new concept, usually with some slides or pictures as support. 

## Top tips
This can be a rather ineffective way to get a new concept across. Losing people's attention is a big danger. Before preparing a lecture, try to find a better way to get your concept across. If you still choose to give a lecture:
* Keep it short - you can say a lot in 5 minutes or less.
* Use visuals - prepare them beforehand or draw them on-the-fly.
* Use stories. People love stories, and they often remember them better than facts.

Giving a good talk or lecture is a huge topic and I will leave it there for now.
