# Table Groups Playing Games

Work in groups of 3-5 seated around tables or in online breakout rooms. Ask them to play a game you have prepared beforehand. Provide materials like cards, dice, sticky notes, coloured pens, flipcharts, etc. The game is designed to illuminate the concept you wish them to learn about.

## Benefits and Pitfalls
* Games can be good for generating 'aha!' moments - that is, when a new idea seems suddenly obvious and useful. 
* Small group discussions can lead to more and better insights than talking in a pair.
* Good for active review exercises where you are asking participants to discuss and categorize materials you've provided them with.
* Good for groups where not everyone is a programmer. You can mix up the perspectives and roles and expose people to new ideas from their peers.
* If not enough people come to your session, it can fall flat.
* One hour might not be enough for some simulations and games, and it can be difficult to split them across two or more days.
