# Code Smells

It's useful to have a vocabularly for talking about refactoring. It will help you to communicate when doing strong-style pairing or mob programming. Code smells is perhaps a less-known concept than refactoring and knowing these names will also help you to communicate about code. In this learning hour we'll talk about what a code smell is and learn the names of a few of them. 

## Session Outline
 
* 5 min connect: collect names of refactorings   
* 2 min concept: Martin Fowler's code smell names 
* 15 mins do: identify code smells in Tennis   
* 10 min demo: Address a code smell
* 25 min do: pairs refactor 
* 5 min reflect: own definition of code smell

### Names of Refactorings
Have people open their IDE refactoring menu and note down the names of the refactorings they use most often. Ask a few people to share their top picks. (If they do not use an IDE, provide a list of refactorings on a handout.)

### Code smells
Ask if anyone in the group can explain what a code smell is. Fill in any gaps in their description.

### Find code smells
Have them review all 3 of the Tennis implementations in [The Tennis Refactoring Kata](https://github.com/emilybache/Tennis-Refactoring-Kata), and note down any code smells they find. The idea is just to read the code at this point, not change it.

When they've looked at the code, write up on a whiteboard the names of smells that they have found. Tell them the 'official' name (from Fowler's book) if they don't know it.

### Address a code smell
Pick one of the smells and look up the corresponding refactoring. Do that refactoring as a demo.

### Do refactoring
Have them do what you just showed them. They can carry on and refactor away more code smells.

### Define 'Code smell'
How would you define 'code smell'? Write a definition on a sticky note and take it with you to put next to your screen.
