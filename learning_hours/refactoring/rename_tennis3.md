# Misconceptions about Refactoring

In this session we talk about what refactoring is and why we do it. We work on improving some names to improve readability.

## Session Outline

* 15 min connect: refactoring warm-up questions   
* 5 min concept: Martin Fowler's refactoring definition
* 30 min do: pairs refactor Tennis3
* 5 min reflect: review warm-up questions


### Discuss Misconceptions
Create a handout with a number of statements about refactoring, which are controvertial, wrong, or only partially true. Ask people to discuss them in small groups and decide whether each statement is true or false. [Here](https://emilybache.github.io/exercises/warm_up_questions/refactoring_warm_up_questions.html) is a sample page of questions you could use.

### Define Refactoring
Put up Martin Fowler's definitions of Refactoring as a noun and verb on a projector screen or write them on a flipchart. Explain how you understand these definitions. You could point out the code shouldn't break while you refactor, and the reason to refactor is primarily economic not moral. You could mention that as you refactor you take a series of small steps and can commit and share your work after any completed step.

### Work on Tennis3
Ask people to note down code smells they see in Tennis3 in [The Tennis Refactoring Kata](https://github.com/emilybache/Tennis-Refactoring-Kata). As the address these smells, ask them to note the names of refactorings they use. Hopefully they will at least find "Mysterious Name" and apply "Rename Variable".

### Reflect
Have people look over the list of questions from earlier and see if they want to change their answers to any of them.
