# Make a test list

In agile, Big Design Up Front (BDUF) is something to be avoided, but that doesn't mean we don't do any design at all. Before starting to code with TDD it really helps to spend a few minutes on Little Design Up Front. Part of that is  making a list of test cases we will work on.

## Session Outline
 
* 5 min connect: what to do before you start coding?
* 10 min concept: Test List
* 30 min do: shopping basket or similar
* 10 min reflect: Correlate test list with TDD cycles

### Connect
Ask people to review [these options](https://emilybache.github.io/exercises/warm_up_questions/tdd_overview_what_would_you_do.html). Ask them to choose an option and read the consequences.

### Concept: Test List
Before writing your first test, you should do a little analysis and identify scenarios that you'll want to make into test cases. Remind people of the test lists you made for previous katas you did in other sessions. 

### Concrete: Write test lists
Ask them to work in pairs to come up with test lists. Give them a requirements document to work from. 

### Conclusions: make a common list
After 15 minutes or so, have pairs report the scenarios they came up with. Write them on a whiteboard and synthesize all the suggestions into a single list.

Repeat with a second problem if there is time.

[Shopping Basket](https://emilybache.github.io/exercises/kata_descriptions/shopping_basket.html) is a good problem for this. There are perhaps half a dozen scenarios to think about and make into a list. [MarsRover](https://emilybache.github.io/exercises/kata_descriptions/mars_rover.html) would also work, or [Fractions](https://emilybache.github.io/exercises/kata_descriptions/fractions.html) or MontyHall.
