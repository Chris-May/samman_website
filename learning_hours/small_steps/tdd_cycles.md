# TDD Cycles

When you're working in TDD you'd like your cycles to be short and fairly regular. Let's look at that today.

## Session Outline
 
* 5 min connect: 3 things about TDD plus one
* 5 min concept: TDD cycle
* 35 min concrete: do some TDD
* 10 min reflect: Correlate test list with TDD cycles


### Connect: 3 things about TDD plus one

Ask participants: What are three things you already know about TDD? Tell them to the person sitting next to you. Bonus: also tell them one thing you want to learn about TDD.

### Concept: TDD Cycle

Bring up an example cyber-dojo screenshot with some traffic lights. Show a TDD cycle. Explain you would like them to be short and fairly regular.

### Concrete: Do some TDD cycles
Pick an exercise, for example on cyber-dojo. Ask them to work on it.

If you've previously done a ['test list'](https://emilybache.github.io/learning_hours/small_steps/test_list.html) learning hour on this kata you could remind them of it and distribute the list you made that time. Otherwise, remind them to make their own test list.

### Reflect: TDD cycles and test list
Review the code and TDD cycles. A tool like cyber-dojo makes test cycles visible, but you can also use the local history in your IDE, or git history. 

- Were the cycles even in length, did you get a good TDD rhythm going?
- Did you have one TDD cycle per test on your list?
- Did you add or remove tests from your list during development?
- What factors lead to successful TDD cycles?
