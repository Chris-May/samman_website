title: Getting C code under test in a Surgery
theme: surgery

These learning hours are specific for the C language. They are all about a specific technique to take code with awkward dependencies and get it under test, which I call 'Surgery'. 

These learning hours and associated exercises are somewhat unpolished and experimental right now.
